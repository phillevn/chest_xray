# chest_xray
We use Bayesian deep learning to classify pneumoia vs. normal from chest xray images.

The goal of this project is to show some benefits of bayesian deep learning. What we obtain after learning is a level of uncertainty of the model prediction. It is very helpful in the case that the input is not from a population that the model had seen from its training. Besides the tuning tools we had in the non-bayesian method, we also have more options to tune our models in order to get a satisfied model.
